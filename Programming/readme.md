# Programming questions

## Question1 (Difficulty level 1)
**Initial Information:**  
How would you declare the variable “Length” and assign it the integer value of 20 using Python?

**Hints:**  
None given

**Solution:**  
Length = 20  

Variables are assigned values using =\.

## Question 2 (Difficulty level 2)
**Initial Information:**  
If you declare the variable “Word” and assign it the text value of “Python”, what is the output of Word[2] using Python?

**Hints:**  
None given

**Solution:**  
t  

Strings are indexed with the first character given the value of 0.

## Question 3 (Difficulty level 3)
**Initial Information:**  
If you declare the variable “Scores” and assign it the list values of: [11, 29, 56]. How do you add the integer value 156 to the end of the list using Python?

**Hints:**  
None given

**Solution:**  
Scores.append(156)

\.append() allows for items to be added to the end of a list

## Question 4 (Difficulty level 4)
**Initial Information:**  
Using Python, fill in the appropriate statement (marked by xx) to make the following statement true:  

    a = 29  
    b = 56  
    xx b > a  
    print (“b is greater than a”)  

**Solution:**  
    xx= if

\“if b is greater than a\” is used as the condition for the statement \“b is greater than a\”
 

Programming 5 (Difficulty Level 5)
**Initial Information:**    In Python, what is the output of the following “for” loop? When entering your answer, be sure to separate the values with commas:

for x in range(5):
print(x)


for x in range (10,15):
print (x)

**Solution:**   0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 10 , 11, 12, 13, 14


“For” loops iterate over a given sequence. In this case, the first sequence is 0-4, denoted by (5) and the second sequence is 10-14, denoted by (10, 15)
